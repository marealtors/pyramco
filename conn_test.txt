# Does your API Key work?
# requires the 'requests' module be installed in python:
# http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/ 
# requires config.py in the same folder and the API key / path set there

# Tests connectivity by querying for the metadata on the 'cobalt_answer' entity, 
# since it's small and not often customized. Looks at the 'ResponseCode' contained 
# in the jsonified reply from the server and returns either 'ok' or 'error' 
# depending on if it gets '200' (which means OK) or any other response code in that reply.
